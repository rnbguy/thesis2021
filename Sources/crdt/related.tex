\label{sec:crdt:related}

Many have considered consistency models applicable to CRDTs, including causal consistency~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Lamport78}, sequential consistency~\cite{DBLP:journals/tc/Lamport79}, linearizability~\cite{DBLP:journals/toplas/HerlihyW90}, session consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/pdis/TerryDPSTW94}, eventual consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/TerryTPDSH95}, and happens-before consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/MansonPA05}. Burckhardt et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/ftpl/Burckhardt14, DBLP:conf/popl/BurckhardtGYZ14} propose a unifying framework to formalize these models. Many have also studied the complexity of verifying data-type agnostic notions of consistency, including serializability, sequential consistency, and linearizability~\cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/Papadimitriou79b, DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97, DBLP:journals/iandc/AlurMP00, DBLP:conf/spaa/BinghamCH03, DBLP:conf/cav/FarzanM08, DBLP:conf/esop/BouajjaniEEH13, DBLP:conf/netys/Hamza15}, as well as causal consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/BouajjaniEGH17}. Our definition of the replicated LWW register corresponds to the notion of causal convergence in~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/BouajjaniEGH17}. This work studies the complexity of the admissibility problem for the replicated LWW register. It shows that this problem is NP-complete in general and polynomial time when each value is written only once. 
Our NP-completeness result is stronger since it assumes a fixed number of replicas, and our algorithm for the case of unique values is more general and can be applied uniformly to MVR and RGA. 
While Bouajjani et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/BouajjaniEEH18, DBLP:journals/pacmpl/EmmiE18} considers the complexity for individual linearizable collection types, we are the first to establish (in)tractability of individual replicated data types. Others have developed effective consistency checking algorithms for sequential consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/HenzingerQR99a, DBLP:journals/tpds/Qadeer03, DBLP:conf/cav/BinghamCHQZ04, DBLP:conf/pldi/BurckhardtAM07}, serializability~\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/0002OPTZ07, DBLP:conf/cav/FarzanM08, DBLP:conf/pldi/GuerraouiHJS08, DBLP:conf/pldi/EmmiMM10}, linearizability~\cite{DBLP:journals/jpdc/WingG93, DBLP:conf/pldi/BurckhardtDMT10, DBLP:conf/pldi/EmmiEH15, DBLP:journals/concurrency/Lowe17}, and even weaker notions like eventual consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/BouajjaniEH14} and sequential happens-before consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/EmmiE18, DBLP:journals/pacmpl/EmmiE19}. 
In contrast, we are the first to establish precise polynomial-time algorithms for runtime verification of replicated data types.
