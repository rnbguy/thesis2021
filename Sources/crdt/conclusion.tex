\section{Conflict free replicated data type}
\label{sec:conclusion}

By developing novel logical characterizations of replicated data types, reductions from propositional satisfiability checking, and tractable algorithms, we have established a frontier of tractability for checking consistency of replicated data types. As far as we are aware, our results are the first to characterize the asymptotic complexity consistency checking for CRDTs.
