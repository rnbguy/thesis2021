\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:crdt:conclusion}

In this chapter, we studied various CRDTs, namely Counter, Set, Flag, Registers, Growing Array. We provide novel formal characterizations for these replicated data types, and study the asymptotic complexity of checking conformance for a given execution. We provide polynomial time algorithms for Growing Array and Registers (when the read-from relation is fixed). For other data types, we prove NP-completeness results based on polynomial time reductions from SAT problems. Then, we provide sound polynomial time algorithms for Counters, Set, Flag when the number of replicas and/or elements are bounded by a fixed constant. Since the latter algorithms are not complete, the asymptotic complexity remains open in these cases.
