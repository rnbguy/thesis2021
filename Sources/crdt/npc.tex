\section{Intractability for Registers, Sets, Flags, and Counters}
\label{sec:intractability}

In this section, we demonstrate that checking the consistency is intractable for many widely-used data types. While this is not completely unexpected, since some related consistency-checking problems like sequential consistency are also intractable~\cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97}, this contrasts recent tractability results for checking strong consistency (i.e.,~linearizability) of common non-replicated data types like sets, maps, and queues~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/EmmiE19}. In fact, in many cases, we show that intractability even holds if the number of replicas is fixed.

Our proofs of intractability follow the general structure of Gibbons and Korach’s proofs for the intractability of checking sequential consistency (SC) for atomic registers with read and write operations~\cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97}. In particular, we reduce a specialized type of NP-hard propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem to checking whether histories are admitted by a given data type. While our construction borrows from Gibbons and Korach’s, the adaptation from SC to CRDT consistency requires a significant extension to handle the consistency relaxation represented by abstract executions: rather than a direct sequencing of threads’ operations, CRDT consistency requires the construction of three separate relations: read-from, happens-before, and linearization.

Technically, our reductions start from the 1-in-3 SAT problem~\cite{DBLP:books/fm/GareyJ79}: given a propositional formula $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with only positive literals, i.e.,~$\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i \in \set{ x_1, \ldots, x_n }$, does there exist an assignment to the variables such that exactly one of $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i$ per clause is assigned $\mathit{true}$? 
The proofs of Theorems~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags} and~\ref{thm:3sat-to-counter} reduce 1-in-3 SAT to CRDT consistency checking.

Besides the flag variable $x_j$ for each propositional variable $x_j$, the encoding adds per-replica variables $y_j$ for synchronization barriers.}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:3sat-to-flags}

  The admissibility problem is NP-hard when the number of replicas is fixed for the following data types: Add-Wins Set, Remove-Wins Set, Enable-Wins Flag, Disable-Wins Flag, Multi-Value Register, and Last-Writer-Wins Register.
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

  We demonstrate a reduction from the 1-in-3 SAT problem. For a given problem $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, we construct a 3-replica history $h_p$ of the flag data type — either enable- or disable-wins — as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:3sat-to-flags}. The encoding includes a flag variable~$x_j$ for each propositional variable $x_j$, along with a per-replica flag variable $y_j$ used to implement synchronization barriers. Intuitively, executions of $h_p$ proceed in $m+1$ rounds: the first round corresponds to the assignment of a truth valuation, while subsequent rounds check the validity of each clause given the assignment. The reductions to sets and registers are slight variations on this proof, in which the \textrm{Read}, \textrm{Enable}, and \textrm{Disable} operations are replaced with \textrm{Contains}, \textrm{Add}, and \textrm{Remove}, respectively, and \textrm{Read} and \textrm{Writes} of values 1 and 0, respectively. 
  
It suffices to show that the constructed history $h_p$ is admitted if and only if the given problem $p$ is satisfiable (it is easy to see that the size of $h_p$ is linear in the size of $p$, and that $h_p$ can be computed in linear time). Since the flag data type does not constrain the linearization relation of its abstract executions, we regard only the read-from and happens-before components. The construction of $h_p$ ensures the happens-before relations of its abstract executions:
  \vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item does not interleave operations from different rounds. Each consecutive rounds are separated by the barriers in happens-before relations; and

    \item at each round, only one replica, say replica $i$, can finish its \textrm{Read}s then finish its \textrm{Enable}s/\textrm{Disable}s, then $(i+1) \bmod 3$ replica can finish its \textrm{Read}s and so on. And these \textrm{Enable}s/\textrm{Disable}s from one round are totally ordered between replicas by the happens-before relation.

\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \end{enumerate}

  In other words, replicas appear to execute atomically per round, in a round-robin fashion. Furthermore, since all operations in a given round happen before the operations of subsequent rounds, the values of flag variables are consistent across rounds — i.e.,~as read by the first replica to execute in a given round — and determined in the initial round either by conflict resolution — i.e.,~enable- or disable-wins — or by happens-before, in case of conflict resolution would have been inconsistent with subsequent reads.

The correctness of the construction is stated in the following lemma:
  
  \begin{lemma}
    \label{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma3}
    $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ is satisfiable if and only if $h_p$ is admissible
  \end{lemma}
  
  \begin{proof}
    (Only-if direction). 
    Assume that $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{1} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ is satisfiable, i.e., there exists a variable assignment $\gamma$ for which each clause has exactly one literal interpreted as true. 
    
    We construct a happens-before relation $\hb$ such that: (1) if $\gamma(x_i) = false$, then $Enable(x_i)$ in Replica 0 is visible to $Disable(x_i)$ in Replica 1, \ie $(Enable(x_i), Disable(x_i)) \in \hb$ (this ensures that the value of $x_i$ is $false$ after Barrier 1), and similarly, (2) if $\gamma(x_i) = true$, then $(Disable(x_i), Enable(x_i)) \in \hb$. Note this does not introduce any cycle in $\hb$ because $x_i$s are \textrm{Enable}d and \textrm{Disable}d in the same order in Replica 0 and Replica 1.

    Then, for each barrier $i$, all the \textrm{Enable} operations happen-before all the \textrm{Read} operations. Also, for each round $i$, if $\alpha_i$ is true in clause $i$ (w.r.t. $\gamma$), then we make all the operations of the round $i$ at replica 0 happen-before operations of the round $i$ at replica 1, and all the operations of the round $i$ at replica 1 happen-before operations of the round $i$ at replica 2. This makes the history admissible because if $\alpha_1$ is true, then $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ are false. So the reads of round $i$ at replica 0 are correct. Then the updates of round $i$ at replica 0 make $\alpha_1$ false and $\beta_1$ true ($\gamma_1$ remains false). So now, the reads of round $i$ at replica 1 are also correct. The same reasoning can be applied for the reads at replica 2. The cases $\beta_i$ true or $\gamma_i$ true lead to a similar definition of happens-before, ordering replicas in the order 1, 2, 0 if $\beta_i$ is true, and 2, 0, 1, if $\gamma_1$ is true. A straightforward proof by induction allows to prove that the history is admissible w.r.t. a happens-before relation defined in this manner.
    
    (If direction). Assume that $h_p$ is admissible. We give a series of lemmas that characterize the happens-before (read-from) relation of $h_p$.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1}
    The \textrm{Read}s of each barrier read from the \textrm{Enable}s or \textrm{Disable}s of the same barrier. 
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    We give a proof by induction on the number of the barrier.
    
    \noindent
    (Base case). Note that only replica $i$ \textrm{Enable}s or \textrm{Disable}s $y_i$. Assume by contradiction that at barrier 1, $\mathrm{Read}(y_j) = true$ at replica $i$ reads from an operation in a barrier other than 1. Then, it must read from an operation of barrier 3 at least ($y_j$ is set to true at odd numbered barriers). Now at barrier 2 and replica j, $\mathrm{Read}(y_i) = false$ reads from a \textrm{Disable} because replica j has $\mathrm{Read}(y_i) = true$ at barrier 1. So at barrier 2 and replica j, $\mathrm{Read}(y_i) = false$ can read from a \textrm{Disable} which is at even numbered barriers, at least from barrier 2. This defines a cycle in the happens-before order, which contradicts the admissibility of $h_p$: 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item $\mathrm{Enable}(y_j)$ at barrier $\geq3$ and replica $j$ happens-before $\mathrm{Read}(y_j) = true$ at barrier 1 and replica $i$ because of read-from, 
	\item $\mathrm{Read}(y_j) = true$ at barrier 1 and replica $i$ happens-before $\mathrm{Disable}(y_i)$ at barrier $\geq2$ and replica $i$,
	\item $\mathrm{Disable}(y_i)$ at barrier $\geq2$ and replica $i$ happens-before $\mathrm{Read}(y_i) = false$ at barrier 2 and replica $j$ because of read-form, and 
	\item $\mathrm{Read}(y_i) = false$ at barrier 2 and replica $j$ happens-before $\mathrm{Enable}(y_j)$ at barrier $\geq3$ and replica $j$.
   \end{itemize}
    
    \noindent
    (Induction step). By the induction hypothesis, barrier $k$ always reads from barrier $k$ itself. Therefore, $\mathrm{Read}(y_j)$ of barrier $(k+1)$ happens after the update of $y_j$ from barrier $k$. Without loss of generality, let us assume that barrier $k$ contains \textrm{Enable} operations. Since barrier $k$ contains  \textrm{Enable} operations, the $false$ reads in barrier $(k+1)$ must read from a barrier strictly greater than $k$. Using the same logic from the base case, this would imply a cycle in the happens-before relation. 
  \end{proof}

Lemma \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1} ensures that all the operations from all replicas before barrier $i$ happen before every operation (from any replica) after barrier $i$.

We say that two \textrm{Read} operations \emph{see the same value of $x_i$} when one \textrm{Read} reads-from an $\mathrm{Enable}(x_i)$ if and only if the other \textrm{Read} also reads-from an $\mathrm{Enable}(x_i)$ (these \textrm{Enable} operations may not be the same). Also, a read in a round $k$ is called \emph{initial} if it does not happen before an \textrm{Enable} or \textrm{Disable} from the same round.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma2}
    Initial \textrm{Read}s of two consecutive rounds see the same value of $x_i$, for each $i$.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
  Note that the \textrm{Read}s from each round read only from updates from the same round or from preceding rounds. Reading from any later round is not possible, because, by Lemma~\ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1},  that will introduce a happen-before cycle between the current round and that later round. Also, in each round, there exist one replica which does not read-from other replicas in the same round. If replica $p$ is reading from replica $q$, then replica $q$ again can not read from replica $p$, because it will create a cycle in $\hb$ between replica $p$ and $q$ in the same round. So replica $q$ has to read from replica $r$. But then replica $r$ will have to read from replica $p$, which creates a cycle between replica $p$, $q$, and $r$ in the same round.

    So there exists one replica, which reads-from updates till last round. Since the \textrm{Read}s of that replica are successful, it ensures only one of $\alpha_k, \beta_k, \gamma_k$ are true \ie only one of those \textrm{Read}s reads-from an \textrm{Enable}. Hence, the first true \textrm{Read}s at other replicas must read-from the updates in the same round. Therefore, all the operations from a round $k \geq 1$ are totally ordered w.r.t. the happens-before, all operations in one replica before all operations in another.  That is, if replica 0 was the first one to finish its reads, $\mathrm{Read}(\beta_k) = true$ reads-from $\mathrm{Enable}(\beta_k)$ and $\mathrm{Read}(\gamma_k) = true$ reads-from $\mathrm{Enable}(\gamma_k)$. Since the updates are totally ordered and they only flip the read values of $x_i$ twice, \ie if the first read on $x_i$ is $false$, then it does not read-from any \textrm{Enable} till round $(k-1)$ and at round $k$, after $\mathrm{Read}(x_i) = false$, $\mathrm{Enable}(x_i)$ and $\mathrm{Disable}(x_i)$ are ordered by $\hb$. So the $\hb$-maximal update on $x_i$ on round $k$ stays $\mathrm{Disable}(x_i)$. Similarly we can show, the $\hb$-maximal update on $x_i$ on round $k$ stays $\mathrm{Enable}(x_i)$ when the first $\mathrm{Read}(x_i)$ was true.

    When round $(k+1)$ begins, because of Lemma~\ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1}, it ``sees'' all the updates at the end of round $k$, which includes the updates from earlier rounds.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $x_i$ is not modified in round $k$, then round $(k+1)$ will read-from from the same update for $x_i$ as round $k$.
      \item If $x_i$ is modified in round $k$, any $\hb$-maximal $\mathrm{Read}(x_i)$ at round $(k+1)$ will read-form $\hb$-maximal updates at round $k$ by lemma \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1}. And, the $\hb$-maximal update on $x_i$ at the end of round $k$ stays the same as the update which round $k$ read-form at the beginning. 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proof}

  Going back to the proof of Lemma \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma3}, $p$ is satisfiable using an assignment defined by the initial \textrm{Read}s of each round (which see the same values by Lemma~\ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma2}). This assignment satisfies the 1-in-3 SAT formula $p$ because at each round, there is a replica that happens-before operations in the same round at the other replicas, and the \textrm{Read}s of that replica see exactly one flag as true.
\end{proof}

%We proved that this reduction from an NP-complete problem to our admissibility works. It is very easy to the size of the history is linear in the size of the formula and can be computed in linear time. The theorem \ref{thm:3sat-to-flags} is proved.

%   In the “if” direction, let $\vec{r} \in \set{0,1,2}^m$ be the positions of positively-assigned variables in each clause, e.g.,~$r_i = 0$ implies $\alpha_i = \mathit{true}$ and $\beta_i = \gamma_i = \mathit{false}$. We construct an abstract execution $e_{\vec{r}}$ in which the happens-before relation sequences the operations of replica~$r_i$ before those of $r_i + 1 \bmod 3$, and in turn before $r_i + 2 \bmod 3$. In other words, the replicas in round $i$ appear to execute in left-to-right order from starting with the replica~$r_i$, whose reads correspond to the satisfying assignment of $(\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$. The read-from relation of $e_{\vec{r}}$ relates each $\mathrm{Read}(x_j) = \mathit{true}$ operation to the most recent $\mathrm{Enable}(x_j)$ operation in happens-before order, which is unique since happens-before sequences the operations of all rounds; the case for $\mathrm{Read}(x_j) = \mathit{false}$ and $\mathrm{Disable}(x_j)$ is symmetric. It is then straightforward to verify that $e_{\vec{r}}$ satisfies the axioms of the enable- or disable-wins flag, and thus $h_p$ is admitted.

%   In the “only if” direction, let $e$ be an abstract execution of $h_p$, and let $\vec{r} \in \set{0,1,2}^m$ be the replicas first to execute in each round according to the happens-before order of $e$. It is straightforward to verify that the assignment in which a given variable is set to true if{f} the replica encoding its positive assignment in some clause executes first in its round, i.e.,
% \vspace{-1mm}
%   \begin{align*}
%     x_j = \left\{
%     \begin{array}{ll}
%       \mathit{true} \qquad & \text{ if } \exists i. (r_i = 0 \land \alpha_i = x_j) \lor (r_i = 1 \land \beta_i = x_j) \lor (r_i = 2 \land \gamma_i = x_j) \\
%       \mathit{false} & \text{ otherwise,}
%     \end{array}
%     \right. \\[-7mm]
%   \end{align*}
%   is a satisfying assignment to $p$.
% \vspace{-1mm}
\end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags} establishes intractability of consistency for the aforementioned sets, flags, and registers, independently from the number of replicas. In contrast, our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-counter} for counter data types depends on the number of replicas, since our encoding requires two replicas per propositional variable. Intuitively, since counter increments and decrements are commutative, the initial round in the previous encoding would have fixed all counter values to zero. Instead, the next encoding isolates initial increments and decrements to independent replicas.
% Todo:
%The weaker result is indeed tight since checking counter consistency with a fixed number of replicas is polynomial time, as Section~\ref{sec:counter} demonstrates.

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:3sat-to-counter}

  The admissibility problem for the Counter data type is NP-hard.

\vspace{-1mm}
\end{theorem}

We demonstrate a reduction from the 1-in-3 SAT problem. For a given problem $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, we construct a history $h_p$ of the counter data type over $2n+3$ replicas, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:3sat-to-counter}.

    \begin{figure}[t]
      \centering
      {\scriptsize\input{Sources/crdt/figures/3sat-to-counter}}
     \vspace{-1mm}
      \caption{The encoding of a 1-in-3 SAT problem $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ as the history of a counter over $2n+3$ replicas. Besides the counter variables $x_j$ encoding propositional variables $x_j$, the encoding adds a variable $y$ encoding the number of initial increments and decrements, and a variable $z$ to implement synchronization barriers.}
      \label{fig:3sat-to-counter}
     \vspace{-4mm}
    \end{figure}

     Besides the differences imposed due to the commutativity of counter increments and decrements, our reduction follows the same strategy as in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags}: the happens-before relation of $h_p$’s abstract executions order every pair of operations in distinct rounds (of Replicas 0–2), and every operation in a given (non-initial) round. As before, Replicas 0–2 appear to execute atomically per round, in a round-robin fashion, and counter variables are consistent across rounds. The key difference is that here abstract executions’ happens-before relations only relate the operations of either Replica~$2j\!+\!1$ or $2j\!+\!2$, for each $j = 1, \ldots, n$, to operations in subsequent rounds: the other’s operations are never observed by other replicas. Our encoding ensures that exactly one of each is observed by ensuring that the counter~$y$ is incremented exactly $n$ times — and relying on the fact that every variable appears in some clause so that a read that observed neither or both would yield the value zero, which is inconsistent with $h_p$. Otherwise, our reasoning follows the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags}, in which the read-from relation selects all increments and decrements of the same counter variable in happens-before order.

% \begin{lemma}
%   \label{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma1}
%   The \textrm{Read}s of each barrier reads from the \textrm{Inc}s or \textrm{Dec}s of the same barrier. 
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
%   Base case. At barrier 1, let's assume replica $i$'s $\mathrm{Read}(z) = 3$ happened-before at first. Then, it must have been three Inc(z) before it. Since the $\mathrm{Read}(z) = 3$ are not performed, the only $Inc(z)$ are available from same barrier but from other replicas. If the second $\mathrm{Read}(z) = 3$ reads from other barrier, then the first replica progressed through some other barrier which $\mathrm{Read}(z) = 0$, which is not possible. So the second read also reads from barrier 1. Similarly the third read also read from barrier 1.

%   Inductive step. This step is very similar to the induction step of lemma \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma1}. Once we prove the base case, we show that the possible reads can only happen from barriers after the current barrier. Then just like the base, we prove reading from any barrier after the current one is not possible. 
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}
%   \label{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma2}
%   At the completion of each sub-history till each round has same assignment for $x_i$s.
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
%   The proof of lemma \ref{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma2} and lemma \ref{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma3} are very similar to the proof of lemma \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma2} and \ref{crdt:flag:npc-proof:lemma3}. Instead of $\mathrm{Enable}$, $\mathrm{Distable}$, $\mathrm{Read}=true$ and $\mathrm{Read}=false$, we have two $\mathrm{Inc}$s, two $\mathrm{Dec}$s, $\mathrm{Read}=1$, $\mathrm{Read}=-1$. Otherwise the proof stays the same.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}
%   \label{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma3}
%   $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{j \leq m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ is satisfied if and only if the sub-history till round j is admissible.
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
%   Theorem \ref{thm:3sat-to-counter} is a direct consequence of lemma \ref{crdt:counter:npc-proof:lemma3} when $j = m$.
