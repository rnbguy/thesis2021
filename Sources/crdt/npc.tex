\section{Intractability for Registers, Sets, Flags, and Counters}
\label{sec:intractability}

In this section we demonstrate that checking the consistency is intractable for many widely-used data types. While this is not completely unexpected, since some related consistency-checking problems like sequential consistency are also intractable~\cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97}, this contrasts recent tractability results for checking strong consistency (i.e.,~linearizability) of common non-replicated data types like sets, maps, and queues~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/EmmiE19}. In fact, in many cases we show that intractability even holds if the number of replicas is fixed.

Our proofs of intractability follow the general structure of Gibbons and Korach’s proofs for the intractability of checking sequential consistency (SC) for atomic registers with read and write operations~\cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97}. In particular, we reduce a specialized type of NP-hard propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem to checking whether histories are admitted by a given data type. While our construction borrows from Gibbons and Korach’s, the adaptation from SC to CRDT consistency requires a significant extension to handle the consistency relaxation represented by abstract executions: rather than a direct sequencing of threads’ operations, CRDT consistency requires the construction of three separate relations: read-from, happens-before, and linearization.

Technically, our reductions start from the 1-in-3 SAT problem~\cite{DBLP:books/fm/GareyJ79}: given a propositional formula $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with only positive literals, i.e.,~$\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i \in \set{ x_1, \ldots, x_n }$, does there exist an assignment to the variables such that exactly one of $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i$ per clause is assigned $\mathit{true}$? The proofs of Theorems~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags} and~\ref{thm:3sat-to-counter} reduce 1-in-3 SAT to CRDT consistency checking.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:3sat-to-flags}

  The admissibility problem is NP-hard when the number of replicas is fixed for the following data types: Add-Wins Set, Remove-Wins Set, Enable-Wins Flag, Disable-Wins Flag, Multi-Value Register, and Last-Writer-Wins Register.
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

  We demonstrate a reduction from the 1-in-3 SAT problem. For a given problem $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, we construct a 3-replica history $h_p$ of the flag data type — either enable- or disable-wins — as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:3sat-to-flags}. The encoding includes a flag variable~$x_j$ for each propositional variable $x_j$, along with a per-replica flag variable $y_j$ used to implement synchronization barriers. Intuitively, executions of $h_p$ proceed in $m+1$ rounds: the first round corresponds to the assignment of a truth valuation, while subsequent rounds check the validity of each clause given the assignment. The reductions to sets and registers are slight variations on this proof, in which the Read, Enable, and Disable operations are replaced with Contains, Add, and Remove, respectively, and Read and Writes of values 1 and 0, respectively.

Besides the flag variable $x_j$ for each propositional variable $x_j$, the encoding adds per-replica variables $y_j$ for synchronization barriers.}

  It suffices to show that the constructed history $h_p$ is admitted if and only if the given problem $p$ is satisfiable. Since the flag data type does not constrain the linearization relation of its abstract executions, we regard only the read-from and happens-before components. It is straightforward to verify that the happens-before relations of $h_p$’s abstract executions necessarily order:
  \vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item every pair of operations in distinct rounds — due to barriers; and

    \item every operation in a given round, over all replicas, without interleaving the operations of distinct replicas within the same round — since a replica’s reads in a given round are only consistent with the other replicas’ after the re-enabling and -disabling of flag variables.
\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \end{enumerate}
  In other words, replicas appear to execute atomically per round, in a round-robin fashion. Furthermore, since all operations in a given round happen before the operations of subsequent rounds, the values of flag variables are consistent across rounds — i.e.,~as read by the first replica to execute in a given round — and determined in the initial round either by conflict resolution — i.e.,~enable- or disable-wins — or by happens-before, in case conflict resolution would have been inconsistent with subsequent reads.

  In the “if” direction, let $\vec{r} \in \set{0,1,2}^m$ be the positions of positively-assigned variables in each clause, e.g.,~$r_i = 0$ implies $\alpha_i = \mathit{true}$ and $\beta_i = \gamma_i = \mathit{false}$. We construct an abstract execution $e_{\vec{r}}$ in which the happens-before relation sequences the operations of replica~$r_i$ before those of $r_i + 1 \bmod 3$, and in turn before $r_i + 2 \bmod 3$. In other words, the replicas in round $i$ appear to execute in left-to-right order from starting with the replica~$r_i$, whose reads correspond to the satisfying assignment of $(\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$. The read-from relation of $e_{\vec{r}}$ relates each $\mathrm{Read}(x_j) = \mathit{true}$ operation to the most recent $\mathrm{Enable}(x_j)$ operation in happens-before order, which is unique since happens-before sequences the operations of all rounds; the case for $\mathrm{Read}(x_j) = \mathit{false}$ and $\mathrm{Disable}(x_j)$ is symmetric. It is then straightforward to verify that $e_{\vec{r}}$ satisfies the axioms of the enable- or disable-wins flag, and thus $h_p$ is admitted.

  In the “only if” direction, let $e$ be an abstract execution of $h_p$, and let $\vec{r} \in \set{0,1,2}^m$ be the replicas first to execute in each round according to the happens-before order of $e$. It is straightforward to verify that the assignment in which a given variable is set to true if{f} the replica encoding its positive assignment in some clause executes first in its round, i.e.,
\vspace{-1mm}
  \begin{align*}
    x_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \mathit{true} \qquad & \text{ if } \exists i. (r_i = 0 \land \alpha_i = x_j) \lor (r_i = 1 \land \beta_i = x_j) \lor (r_i = 2 \land \gamma_i = x_j) \\
      \mathit{false} & \text{ otherwise,}
    \end{array}
    \right. \\[-7mm]
  \end{align*}
  is a satisfying assignment to $p$. \qed
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags} establishes intractability of consistency for the aforementioned sets, flags, and registers, independently from the number of replicas. In contrast, our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-counter} for counter data types depends on the number of replicas, since our encoding requires two replicas per propositional variable. Intuitively, since counter increments and decrements are commutative, the initial round in the previous encoding would have fixed all counter values to zero. Instead, the next encoding isolates initial increments and decrements to independent replicas. The weaker result is indeed tight since checking counter consistency with a fixed number of replicas is polynomial time, as Section~\ref{sec:counter} demonstrates.

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:3sat-to-counter}

  The admissibility problem for the Counter data type is NP-hard.

\vspace{-1mm}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    We demonstrate a reduction from the 1-in-3 SAT problem. For a given problem $p = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, we construct a history $h_p$ of the counter data type over $2n+3$ replicas, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:3sat-to-counter}.

    \begin{figure}[t]
      \centering
      {\scriptsize\input{Sources/crdt/figures/3sat-to-counter}}
     \vspace{-1mm}
      \caption{The encoding of a 1-in-3 SAT problem $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} (\alpha_i \lor \beta_i \lor \gamma_i)$ over variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ as the history of a counter over $2n+3$ replicas. Besides the counter variables $x_j$ encoding propositional variables $x_j$, the encoding adds a variable $y$ encoding the number of initial increments and decrements, and a variable $z$ to implement synchronization barriers.}
      \label{fig:3sat-to-counter}
     \vspace{-4mm}
    \end{figure}

     Besides the differences imposed due to the commutativity of counter increments and decrements, our reduction follows the same strategy as in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags}: the happens-before relation of $h_p$’s abstract executions order every pair of operations in distinct rounds (of Replicas 0–2), and every operation in a given (non-initial) round. As before, Replicas 0–2 appear to execute atomically per round, in a round-robin fashion, and counter variables are consistent across rounds. The key difference is that here abstract executions’ happens-before relations only relate the operations of either Replica~$2j\!+\!1$ or $2j\!+\!2$, for each $j = 1, \ldots, n$, to operations in subsequent rounds: the other’s operations are never observed by other replicas. Our encoding ensures that exactly one of each is observed by ensuring that the counter~$y$ is incremented exactly $n$ times — and relying on the fact that every variable appears in some clause, so that a read that observed neither or both would yield the value zero, which is inconsistent with $h_p$. Otherwise, our reasoning follows the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:3sat-to-flags}, in which the read-from relation selects all increments and decrements of the same counter variable in happens-before order. \qed
