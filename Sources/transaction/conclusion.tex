\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:txn:conclusion}

We propose novel logical characterizations of various weak consistency models of transactional system such as \emph{Read Committed} (RC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95}, \emph{Read Atomic} (RA)~\cite{DBLP:conf/concur/Cerone0G15},  \emph{Causal Consistency} (CC)~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Lamport78}, \emph{Prefix Consistency} (PC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/BurckhardtLPF15}, \emph{Snapshot Isolation} (SI)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95} and Serializability (SER). We also investigate the intractibility of these problems. We prove tractability for some cases, but we also show tractability can be regained by considering histories with a bounded number of sessions.
