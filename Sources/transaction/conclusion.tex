\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:txn:conclusion}

In this chapter, we proposed novel logical characterizations of various consistency models of transactional systems such as \emph{Read Committed} (RC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95}, \emph{Read Atomic} (RA)~\cite{DBLP:conf/concur/Cerone0G15},  \emph{Causal Consistency} (CC)~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Lamport78}, \emph{Prefix Consistency} (PC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/BurckhardtLPF15}, \emph{Snapshot Isolation} (SI)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95} and Serializability (SER). This enables an investigation of algorithmic techniques for checking conformance of a given execution. We establish the asymptotic complexity of this problem for each consistency model when the read-from relation is known apriori. We introduce polynomial-time algorithms for RC, RA, CC, and prove that checking conformance for PC, SI, and SER is NP-complete. In the latter case, we introduce conformance checking algorithms that are polynomial time when the number of bi-connected components of the communication graph is bounded by a fixed constant. Finally, we demonstrate a runtime performance analysis of an implementation of our algorithms based on histories from production databases. As benchmark, we consider histories extracted from three distributed databases: CockroachDB~\cite{cockroach}, Galera~\cite{galera}, and AntidoteDB~\cite{antidote}. Using our implementation, we were able to find bugs in all these distributed databases, which confirms their incorrect promises on strong guarantees (CockroachDB) or previously mentioned bugs (Galera) or novel bugs (AntidoteDB).
