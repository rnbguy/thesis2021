\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:txn:conclusion}

In this chapter, we propose novel logical characterizations of various weak consistency models of transactional system such as \emph{Read Committed} (RC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95}, \emph{Read Atomic} (RA)~\cite{DBLP:conf/concur/Cerone0G15},  \emph{Causal Consistency} (CC)~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Lamport78}, \emph{Prefix Consistency} (PC)~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/BurckhardtLPF15}, \emph{Snapshot Isolation} (SI)~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95} and Serializability (SER) in terms of axioms in first order logic. This enables us to formally reason about the problem of checking conformance of histories on transactional systems in a testing framework. We investigate the asymptotic complexities of this problem for each consistency model when the read-from relation is known. We prove polynomial time complexities and discuss corresponding algorithms for RC, RA, CC. Although we prove the checking conformance of PC, SI, SER consistent histories are NP-complete, we prove there exist polynomial time algorithms to check conformance of these histories when the communication graph of these graph has bi-connected components bounded by a fixed number. Finally, we demonstrate a runtime performance analysis of an implementation of our algorithms based on histories from production databases. As benchmark, we consider histories extracted from three distributed databases: CockroachDB~\cite{cockroach}, Galera~\cite{galera}, and AntidoteDB~\cite{antidote}. Using our implementation, we were able to find bugs for these distributed databases, which confirms their incorrect promises on strong guarantees (CockroachDB) or previously mentioned bug (Galera) or a new bug (AntidoteDB) which is confirmed by the database team.
