\section{SQL database}
\label{sec:conc}

Our goal is to enable developers to test the correctness of their storage-backed applications under 
weak isolation levels. Such bugs are hard to catch because weak behaviors are
rarely generated by real storage systems, but failure to address them can lead
to loss of business \cite{acidrain}. We present MonkeyDB, an easy-to-use mock storage system
for weeding out such bugs. MonkeyDB uses a logical understanding of isolation
levels to provide (randomized) coverage of all possible weak behaviors. Our evaluation reveals that
using MonkeyDB is very effective at breaking assertions that would otherwise
hold under a strong isolation level.
