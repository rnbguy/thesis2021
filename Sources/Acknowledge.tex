First and foremost, I have to thank my supervisor M. Constantin Enea. Without his assitance and dedicated involment in every step throughout the process; this thesis would have been accomplished. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over the last three years.

I also like to thank my faculties in undergrad university, Chennai Mathematical Institute, where I did my bachelors and masters. Thank you Prof. Srivatsan Balaguru, for your lectures inspiring me to choose computer science. 

Most importantly, none of this could have ever happened without my family. My mother, father and my brothers and my grand parents.

Anjum - thank you for adopting a brother and sending me continuous support and guidance in life. Simone, Melisa - thank you for keeping me sane through my PhD. Paula thank you for everything.
