First and foremost, I have to thank my supervisor M. Constantin Enea. Without his assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process; this thesis would have been accomplished. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over the last three years.

Also I would like to show my gratitude to the jury members, Mr. Bengt Jonsson (Professor, Uppsala University, Sweden), Mr. Ilya Sergey (Associate Professor, Yale-NUS College, Singapore), Mme. Mihaela Sighireanu (Professor, ENS Paris-Saclay, France), Mr. Noam Rinetzky (Associate Professor, Tel Aviv University, Israel), M. Viktor Vafeiadis (Tenured Researcher, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), Kaiserslautern). Thank you for taking time to go through my thesis and your valuable comments and remarks.

I also like to thank my faculties in undergrad university, Chennai Mathematical Institute (Chennai, India). Thank you Mr. Balaguru Srivathsan, for your lectures that inspired me to choose Computer Science as my career. This PhD opportunity would have never been possible without your guidance and advice.

Most importantly, none of this could have ever happened without my family. My mother Kanyakumarika Biswas, my father Ramtanu Biswas and my grandparents Namita Paik and Krishnapada Paik and my brothers Rudradeep Biswas and Suvadeep Biswas and my uncle Arup Paik. Without your love, support and scolding, I would never reach the place where I am right now.

But last but not least, this journey would not be completed without my friends. My school friends Sanchari Chakraborty, Subhajit Mukherjee, Poulomi Aich - thanks for your continuous support and advice for my life choices. Darshana Krishnamony - thank you for being the first helping hand and friend in Paris. You were there for me when I had no one in Paris. Anjum Mullani - thank you for adopting a brother in Europe and teaching me to be a better person in life. You are the sister I never had. Melisa Benakay and Simone Perriello - thank you for keeping me sane. You are the best of friends that I could never imagine. Thank you Paula Souto Montero for all the love and support. You have been an amazing and loving person.
