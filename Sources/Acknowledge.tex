I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my advisors, teachers, colleagues, family, and friends, without whom this dissertation would not have been possible - who accompanied and helped me through my Ph.D. journey.

My deepest gratitude to my supervisors Dr. Ahmed Bouajjani and Dr. Constantin Enea - without their assistance, advice, and motivation through the past three and half years, this thesis would not have been possible, especially in the time of this pandemic. They taught me the nitty-gritties of verification of distributed systems, and most importantly how to challenge myself to become a good researcher which I will treasure forever. I could not have imagined having better advisors and mentors for my doctoral study.

I would also like to thank the jury: Dr. Bengt Jonsson, Dr. Ilya Sergey, Dr. Mihaela Sighireanu, Dr. Noam Rinetzky, Dr. Viktor Vafeiadis. Bengt and Ilya were very kind to review my dissertation in this challenging time - Thank you.

A good support system is important. Thanks to my colleagues and friends Sidi Mohamed Beillahi, Berk Cirisci, Suha Orhun Mutluergil, Rachid Zennou, for being there every step of the way and for making IRIF so friendly. Whenever I was stuck with some problems, our discussions helped me progress. I would also like to thank the administrative staff at ED 386, IRIF, and UFR Informatique for their help during my stay for the research.

My Ph.D. would not have happened without the amazing professors of Chennai Mathematical Institute (Chennai, India). Thank you Dr. Balaguru Srivathsan, for your guidance, advice, and lectures that inspired me to choose Computer Science as my career. 

Most importantly, my family - without whom, this would have never happened. My parents Kanyakumarika and Ramtanu Biswas, grandparents Namita and Krishnapada Paik, my brothers Rudradeep and Suvadeep, and uncle Arup Paik - your love, sacrifice, and unconditional support helped me reach where I am right now.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my friends who made this journey interesting and fun. Poulomi, Mouli, Subhajit, Sanchari, Kanchan, Sougata, Abhishek, Arpita - thank you for everything. Darshana - thank you for being my first friend in Paris, so far away from home.  Anjum - thank you for adopting me as a brother, you are the sister I never had. Melisa and Simone - thank you for keeping me sane with all the best that is there to experience in Europe, you are the best of friends that I could have ever asked for. Thank you Paula for all the love and support.

In the end, I would like to thank each and everyone in my life, who made me a better person and helped me reach this position.

Thank you!
